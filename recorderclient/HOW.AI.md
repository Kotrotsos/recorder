# HOW.AI

This file documents complex parts of the codebase and explains how they work.

## Pricing Page Layout

### March 13, 2025

The pricing page uses a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes:

1. **Mobile View**: On smaller screens, the pricing columns stack vertically for better readability.
   - This is achieved using `flex-col` in the base styling and `md:flex-row` for larger screens.
   - Each pricing card takes full width on mobile.

2. **Desktop View**: On larger screens (md breakpoint and above), the pricing columns display side by side.
   - The Free plan uses `max-w-md` to maintain a standard width.
   - The Lifetime Supporter plan uses `max-w-sm` to make it slightly smaller than the Free plan.

3. **Visual Differentiation**:
   - The Free plan uses a pink/purple color scheme.
   - The Lifetime Supporter plan uses an amber/yellow color scheme to stand out.
   - Both plans have subtle animations applied through CSS keyframes defined in the useEffect hook.

4. **Background Effects**:
   - The page uses animated gradient backgrounds with floating "blob" elements.
   - These animations are defined in a style tag injected via useEffect to ensure they only run on the client side.
   - The animations include gradient shifts and floating movements to create a dynamic, engaging background.

## Supporter Messaging Strategy

### March 13, 2025

The Lifetime Supporter plan uses specific messaging techniques to connect with potential supporters:

1. **Transparency About Development Status**:
   - Clearly communicates that premium features are in development
   - Uses a styled callout box with a border accent in the supporter color scheme
   - Maintains honesty while building anticipation

2. **Value Proposition Elements**:
   - Early access to new features (exclusivity)
   - Supporting indie development (emotional connection)
   - Lifetime access (long-term value)
   - One-time payment (simplicity and clarity)

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Important phrases like "first to access them" are highlighted with different styling
   - The callout box appears before the feature list to set context
   - FAQ section provides additional details for those who want more information

4. **Community Building**:
   - Language focuses on the journey and making it possible together
   - Emphasizes gratitude to create a positive supporter relationship
   - Positions supporters as essential partners in the development process

## Stripe Payment Integration

### March 13, 2025 - Updated 23:45 CET

The Stripe payment integration uses Next.js API routes to securely process payments:

1. **Architecture Overview**:
   - Client-side: StripeCheckout component in React
   - Server-side: Next.js API route for creating checkout sessions
   - Payment processing: Stripe Checkout hosted page

2. **Payment Flow**:
   - User clicks "Become a Supporter" button
   - StripeCheckout component calls the Next.js API route
   - API route creates a Stripe Checkout session
   - User is redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout page
   - After payment, user is redirected to success page

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Stripe secret key is only used in the server-side API route, never exposed to the client
   - Next.js API routes run on the server, keeping sensitive operations secure
   - Payment processing happens on Stripe's PCI-compliant servers

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Client-side error handling with visual feedback for users
   - Detailed console logging throughout the checkout process
   - Server-side error handling with appropriate status codes
   - Graceful error recovery if Stripe fails to load

5. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Environment variables for Stripe API keys and configuration
   - Public keys prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side access
   - Secret keys only used in server-side code
   - Success and cancel URLs must match the actual server port

6. **Stripe Products vs Prices**:
   - Products: Represent what you're selling (e.g., "Lifetime Supporter Plan")
   - Prices: Represent how much the product costs (e.g., "$29.99 one-time payment")
   - Price IDs always start with `price_` (e.g., `price_1OxYZAG1OX3gPFMJLADYDB3bv`)
   - Product IDs always start with `prod_` (e.g., `prod_RwCNpJzs4emdLf`)
   - The Stripe checkout requires a price ID, not a product ID
   - One product can have multiple prices (e.g., monthly, yearly, lifetime)

7. **Debugging Stripe Issues**:
   - Check server logs for detailed error information
   - Verify that the price ID exists in your Stripe dashboard
   - Ensure success and cancel URLs match your server's port
   - Test with Stripe's test card numbers (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242)
   - Verify that your Stripe account is properly configured for your region

## Stripe API Key Verification System

### March 13, 2025

The Stripe API key verification system provides a comprehensive way to test and validate Stripe API keys:

1. **Verification Architecture**:
   - Client-side: React page with status indicators for both publishable and secret keys
   - Server-side: Next.js API route that safely tests the secret key
   - Dual verification approach ensures both client and server integrations work correctly

2. **Client-Side Verification (Publishable Key)**:
   - Tests if the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variable is set
   - Attempts to initialize the Stripe.js library with the publishable key
   - Provides visual feedback on success or failure
   - Securely masks the key when displaying it (e.g., `pk_test_51MR...1DHx`)

3. **Server-Side Verification (Secret Key)**:
   - Tests if the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set
   - Initializes the Stripe Node.js library with the secret key
   - Makes a lightweight API call (balance retrieval) to verify the key works
   - Returns detailed error information for troubleshooting
   - Securely masks the key in logs and responses

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Never exposes full API keys in the UI or logs
   - Uses key masking to show only the first 8 and last 4 characters
   - Keeps secret key operations exclusively on the server side
   - Provides specific error messages without revealing sensitive information

5. **Error Handling and Feedback**:
   - Categorizes errors by type (authentication, connection, etc.)
   - Provides specific error messages based on the error type
   - Uses color-coded visual indicators (green for success, red for failure)
   - Includes troubleshooting tips for common issues

6. **Implementation Details**:
   - Uses React's `useEffect` hook for initialization on component mount
   - Implements async/await pattern for API calls
   - Provides loading states during verification
   - Uses try/catch blocks for robust error handling
   - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios

7. **Troubleshooting Guidance**:
   - Includes a dedicated troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
   - Provides visual guidance on expected key formats (pk_test_* and sk_test_*)
   - Suggests checking for account restrictions or creating new API keys
   - Reminds users to ensure keys are from the same Stripe account

## Stripe redirectToCheckout Best Practices

### March 13, 2025

When using Stripe's redirectToCheckout method, it's important to follow these best practices to avoid integration errors:

1. **Client vs. Server Parameter Separation**:
   - All configuration parameters should be set on the server side when creating the checkout session
   - The client side should only pass the `sessionId` to `redirectToCheckout` without any additional parameters
   - Mixing parameters between client and server will cause an `IntegrationError`

2. **Correct Implementation Pattern**:
   - Server: Create a checkout session with all desired configuration options
   - Server: Return only the session ID to the client
   - Client: Call `stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId })` with no other parameters

3. **Common Errors and Solutions**:
   - `IntegrationError: Do not provide other parameters when providing sessionId`: Remove all parameters except `sessionId` from the client-side call
   - `No such parameter: payment_method_types`: Check the Stripe API version and use only supported parameters
   - `Invalid value for locale`: Set the locale on the server side, not the client side

4. **API Version Considerations**:
   - Always specify the Stripe API version when initializing the Stripe object
   - Different API versions support different parameters
   - The latest API version may have breaking changes from previous versions
   - Test thoroughly when upgrading API versions

5. **Security Benefits**:
   - Keeping configuration on the server side prevents tampering
   - Prices, products, and other sensitive data remain secure
   - The client only needs to know the session ID, not the full configuration

## Lifetime Supporter Badge System

### March 13, 2025

The lifetime supporter badge system provides visual recognition for users who have purchased the lifetime supporter plan:

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Uses the existing `subscriptions` table to store supporter status
   - Records include user ID, plan type, payment details, and status
   - Lifetime subscriptions have `plan_id` set to `lifetime_supporter` and `status` set to `active`
   - The `current_period_end` is set to `null` to indicate it never expires

2. **Payment Processing Flow**:
   - User initiates checkout through the StripeCheckout component
   - Checkout session includes user ID and plan type in metadata
   - After successful payment, Stripe sends a webhook event to our server
   - Webhook handler verifies the payment and adds the subscription to the database
   - Success page checks and displays the user's new supporter status

3. **Visual Indicators**:
   - `SupporterBadge` component provides a consistent visual indicator across the app
   - Badge includes an animated gold dot with a pulsing effect
   - Optional text label "Lifetime Supporter" can be shown or hidden
   - Badge appears in the user profile and payment success page
   - Loading state handles asynchronous status checking

4. **Status Verification**:
   - `isLifetimeSupporter()` utility function checks if the current user is a supporter
   - Function queries the database for active lifetime subscriptions
   - Results are cached in component state to minimize database queries
   - Error handling ensures graceful degradation if status check fails

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Supporter status is verified server-side through database queries
   - Webhook signature verification prevents fraudulent subscription creation
   - User authentication is required for checkout and status checks
   - Payment processing happens entirely through Stripe's secure systems

6. **User Experience**:
   - Supporters receive immediate visual confirmation of their status
   - Profile page shows detailed information about their supporter benefits
   - Success page provides transaction details and confirmation
   - Badge creates a sense of exclusivity and recognition

## Stripe Webhook Architecture

### March 13, 2025

The Stripe webhook system uses Supabase Edge Functions to process payment events:

1. **Edge Function vs. API Route**:
   - Webhook handler implemented as a Supabase Edge Function rather than a Next.js API route
   - Edge Functions run on Deno runtime at the edge, closer to users
   - Provides better performance, scalability, and reliability for webhook processing
   - Reduces load on the main application server

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Located at `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`
   - Uses Deno's standard HTTP server library
   - Implements CORS handling for cross-origin requests
   - Verifies webhook signatures using Stripe's official method
   - Connects directly to the Supabase database for subscription management

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Validates Stripe signature to prevent fraudulent webhook events
   - Uses Supabase service role key for database operations
   - Implements proper error handling and status codes
   - Logs detailed information for debugging without exposing sensitive data

4. **Webhook Flow**:
   - Stripe sends a POST request to the webhook endpoint after a successful payment
   - Edge function verifies the signature using the webhook secret
   - For checkout.session.completed events, the function checks if it's a lifetime plan
   - If valid, it retrieves customer details and extracts the user ID
   - Creates a new subscription record in the database with payment details
   - Returns a 200 response to acknowledge receipt of the webhook

5. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Requires `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` for Stripe API access
   - Needs `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for signature verification
   - Uses `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for database access
   - All secrets are stored securely in Supabase environment variables

6. **Deployment Process**:
   - Edge Functions are deployed using Supabase CLI
   - Changes are versioned in the repository
   - No cold start issues compared to serverless functions
   - Automatically scales based on incoming webhook volume

## Authentication Flow for Pricing and Checkout

### March 13, 2025

The pricing page implements a robust authentication flow to ensure users are properly logged in before making purchases:

1. **Client-Side Authentication Check**:
   - The PricingPageClient component checks authentication status on mount
   - Uses Supabase Auth's `getUser()` method to verify if a user is logged in
   - Maintains loading state during authentication check for better UX
   - Caches user data in component state to avoid unnecessary re-fetches

2. **Conditional Button Rendering**:
   - For authenticated users: Shows the "Become a Supporter" button with Stripe checkout
   - For unauthenticated users: Shows a "Login to Become a Supporter" button
   - During loading: Shows a disabled button with loading state
   - Uses a dedicated `renderSupporterButton()` function for clean conditional logic

3. **Login Redirect Flow**:
   - Unauthenticated users are directed to the login page with a `redirect` query parameter
   - After successful login, users are redirected back to the pricing page
   - This creates a seamless experience without losing context
   - Example URL: `/login?redirect=/pricing`

4. **Server-Side Verification**:
   - Even with client-side checks, the API route performs its own authentication verification
   - Uses `createServerComponentClient` to access Supabase Auth on the server
   - Returns 401 Unauthorized if a user attempts to create a checkout session without being logged in
   - Provides clear error messages to guide users

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Double verification (client and server) prevents unauthorized checkout attempts
   - User ID is included in checkout session metadata for proper attribution
   - Authentication state is checked fresh on each page load
   - Sensitive operations only proceed with valid authentication

## Navigation Bar Authentication State

### March 13, 2025

The navigation bar implements a consistent authentication state display across the application:

1. **Shared Authentication State**:
   - The same authentication state is used for both the navigation bar and the pricing buttons
   - Authentication state is checked once on component mount and shared across the UI
   - This ensures consistent UI representation of the user's login status

2. **Visual States**:
   - Unauthenticated: Shows "Login" link
   - Authenticated: Shows "Account" link
   - Loading: Shows an animated placeholder during authentication check
   - Supporter: Shows a supporter badge next to the Account link

3. **Supporter Badge Integration**:
   - The supporter badge appears in the navigation bar for lifetime supporters
   - Uses the same `SupporterBadge` component as other parts of the application
   - Configured with `showText={false}` for a compact display in the navigation
   - Provides immediate visual feedback about supporter status

4. **Button State Coordination**:
   - The "Become a Supporter" button changes to a confirmation message for existing supporters
   - This prevents supporters from attempting to purchase the plan again
   - The confirmation message uses a slightly darker gradient to indicate it's not clickable
   - Includes a checkmark symbol (✓) for clear visual confirmation

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - Uses a single `useEffect` hook to check both authentication and supporter status
   - Caches results in component state for efficient rendering
   - Handles error cases gracefully to prevent UI breakage
   - Maintains loading states during asynchronous operations

## Navigation Bar Styling

### March 14, 2025

The navigation bar implements consistent styling and alignment across all components:

1. **Vertical Alignment Strategy**:
   - All navigation elements use `flex items-center` to ensure proper vertical alignment
   - Each list item (`<li>`) has `flex items-center` to align its contents
   - Links and buttons within navigation use `flex items-center` for consistent alignment
   - This creates a clean, professional appearance with all elements properly centered

2. **Component Consistency**:
   - The same alignment approach is applied across all components:
     - PageContent.tsx (main application layout)
     - PricingPageClient.tsx
     - AboutPageClient.tsx
     - auth-layout.tsx (authentication pages)
     - terms-layout.tsx (terms and conditions pages)
   - This ensures a consistent user experience throughout the application

3. **Responsive Considerations**:
   - The navigation maintains proper alignment on all screen sizes
   - Special elements like the "You are awesome, Goldmember" message are hidden on mobile
   - The supporter badge remains properly aligned in both desktop and mobile views

4. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - The navigation maintains clear visual hierarchy with the logo on the left
   - Navigation links are grouped together with consistent spacing
   - The account/login button is visually distinct with a rounded background
   - All elements maintain proper vertical alignment for a polished appearance

## Enhanced Authentication Approach

### March 13, 2025

The enhanced authentication system ensures a consistent login state across the application:

1. **Dual Authentication Check**:
   - Initial check using `getSession()` to immediately retrieve the current session
   - Ongoing listener with `onAuthStateChange` to react to auth state changes
   - This combination provides both immediate state and reactive updates

2. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions are checked directly rather than just user data
   - This ensures access to the full authentication context
   - Session tokens are properly validated on each page load
   - Handles token refresh and expiration automatically

3. **Error Handling & Diagnostics**:
   - Comprehensive error tracking with visible feedback
   - Development mode debug panel showing auth state, user ID, and supporter status
   - Detailed console logging for each step of the authentication process
   - Clear visual indicators for authentication errors

4. **State Synchronization**:
   - Authentication state is centralized and consistently applied
   - Prevents desynchronization between different UI components
   - Minimizes auth checks by sharing state across the component
   - Cleanup function properly unsubscribes from auth listeners on unmount

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Minimizes database queries by checking supporter status only after confirmed login
   - Uses state caching to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Implements loading states to handle authentication delays
   - Provides graceful fallbacks when authentication is pending

6. **User Experience**:
   - Users receive immediate visual feedback about their authentication state
   - Loading indicators prevent confusion during auth state transitions
   - Error messages guide users when authentication issues occur
   - Consistent navigation UI across all application pages

## Cross-Page Authentication Persistence

### March 13, 2025

To ensure authentication state persists correctly across different pages:

1. **Client Initialization**:
   - Create Supabase client once at the component level to prevent multiple instances
   - Use a consistent approach for client creation across all pages
   - Avoid recreating clients during re-renders or state changes

2. **Component-Specific Logging**:
   - Each page component includes its name in log messages for easier debugging
   - Log authentication state changes with detailed context
   - Track component lifecycle events (mount, unmount) to identify potential issues
   - Add clear visual indicators in development mode for auth state

3. **Optimized Dependencies**:
   - Focus useEffect dependency arrays to only include required dependencies
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies that could trigger re-initialization
   - Ensure router is not causing unnecessary re-renders of authentication logic

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - Extract repeated operations like supporter status checks into reusable functions
   - Centralize authentication logic to reduce duplication
   - Keep authentication state checking consistent across components
   - Add appropriate error handling for each step of the process

5. **Debug-Friendly Architecture**:
   - Allow detailed component-specific logging in development mode
   - Add visual debugging tools that persist across navigation
   - Implement clear state transitions with appropriate loading indicators
   - Provide fallback UI for authentication edge cases

6. **Session Priority**:
   - Always check the full session rather than just user data
   - Validate authentication on both client and server sides
   - Use getSession() for more reliable results than older methods
   - Ensure proper handling of token refreshes and expirations

## Supabase Authentication Implementation

### March 14, 2025 - Updated 12:00 CET

   - Status update function in subscription utilities
   - Enhanced isLifetimeSupporter function to check for 'goldmember' status
   - Integration with PageContent component for header display
   - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - URL parameter extraction for user identification when session is not available

9. **Session Persistence Challenges**:
   - Authentication sessions may be lost during external redirects (like Stripe checkout)
   - URL parameters provide a fallback mechanism for maintaining user context
   - The success URL includes the user ID as a query parameter
   - The payment success page extracts this ID when the session is not available
   - This approach ensures subscription updates work even when authentication is temporarily lost 

## Row Level Security and Service Role Implementation

### March 14, 2025 - Updated 19:00 CET

Supabase uses Row Level Security (RLS) policies to control access to database tables. This section explains how we handle these policies in our application:

1. **Row Level Security Policies**:
   - RLS policies restrict which rows a user can select, insert, update, or delete
   - For the subscriptions table, users can only access rows where `user_id` equals their own `auth.uid()`
   - This prevents users from modifying other users' subscription data
   - When authentication is lost (e.g., after a redirect), these policies block database operations

2. **Service Role Approach**:
   - The service role key bypasses RLS policies, allowing administrative access
   - We use this approach in server-side API routes for operations that require elevated permissions
   - The service role key is never exposed to the client side
   - This maintains security while allowing necessary database operations

3. **API Route Implementation**:
   - Created a dedicated `/api/update-subscription-status` endpoint
   - The endpoint accepts a user ID and performs the subscription update server-side
   - Uses the service role key to bypass RLS policies
   - Implements proper error handling and response formatting
   - Returns the updated subscription data to the client

4. **Database Constraints Handling**:
   - The subscriptions table has NOT NULL constraints on several columns
   - For lifetime subscriptions, we use a far future date (100 years) for `current_period_end` instead of null
   - This approach maintains the concept of a "lifetime" subscription while respecting database constraints
   - All required fields are properly populated during insert and update operations
   - Detailed error handling captures and reports constraint violations

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Service role key is stored as a server-side environment variable
   - API routes validate input parameters before performing operations
   - Detailed error messages are logged server-side but simplified for client responses
   - User ID is still required to ensure operations target the correct user
   - All operations are performed through secure API endpoints

6. **Client-Side Integration**:
   - Client components call the API route instead of directly accessing the database
   - User ID is passed as a parameter to identify which user to update
   - Success and error states are handled based on the API response
   - This approach maintains security while providing necessary functionality

7. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - API routes return appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios
   - Detailed error information is logged server-side for debugging
   - Client-side error messages are user-friendly and actionable
   - Fallback mechanisms ensure a good user experience even when errors occur

8. **Implementation Details**:
   - Service role client is initialized with `autoRefreshToken: false` and `persistSession: false`
   - API routes use try/catch blocks for robust error handling
   - Database operations include proper `.select()` calls to return updated data
   - Response formatting follows a consistent pattern across all API routes 

## Goldmember Status Management Tools

### March 14, 2025 - 21:00 CET

The application includes administrative tools and user-facing status checks for managing goldmember status:

1. **Admin Tools Page**:
   - Located at `/admin-tools`
   - Provides an interface for administrators to update user subscription status
   - Uses the `/api/update-subscription-status` API endpoint to modify subscription records
   - Bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) using the service role key
   - Handles both creating new subscription records and updating existing ones
   - Provides detailed feedback on the operation's success or failure

2. **Status Check Page**:
   - Located at `/check-status`
   - Allows users to verify their own goldmember status
   - Displays comprehensive subscription information
   - Shows user details, supporter status, and subscription records
   - Uses the `isLifetimeSupporter()` function to check status
   - Provides visual indicators for goldmember status with amber highlighting
   - Includes a refresh button to check for status updates in real-time

3. **Subscription Status Logic**:
   - The `isLifetimeSupporter()` function checks for both 'active' and 'goldmember' statuses
   - Uses an OR condition in the database query: `or('status.eq.active,status.eq.goldmember')`
   - This ensures that users with either status are recognized as supporters
   - The function returns a boolean that components use to conditionally render UI elements

4. **Database Structure**:
   - Subscriptions table includes fields for user_id, plan_id, status, and timestamps
   - The 'goldmember' status indicates a lifetime supporter with premium access
   - Each user can have multiple subscription records, but typically only one is active
   - The current_period_end field uses a far future date (100 years) for lifetime subscriptions

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Admin tools should only be accessible to authorized administrators
   - The service role key is only used server-side in API routes
   - User ID validation ensures operations only affect the intended user
   - Detailed error handling prevents information leakage

6. **Troubleshooting Process**:
   - Check if the user has a subscription record in the database
   - Verify that the subscription status is either 'active' or 'goldmember'
   - Ensure the plan_id is set to 'lifetime_supporter'
   - Use the admin tools to create or update subscription records if needed
   - Have the user check their status on the status check page
   - Refresh the application to ensure the latest status is recognized

   - **RLS Policies**: Use service role key for administrative operations
   - **Query Formatting**: Ensure proper OR conditions for status checks
   - **Authentication State**: Verify user is authenticated before checking subscriptions
   - **Database Constraints**: Handle NULL values and required fields properly 

## Transcript Summarization Process

### March 14, 2025

The transcript summarization process in the audio recorder component follows these steps:

1. **User Flow**:
   - User records or uploads audio
   - Audio is transcribed to text
   - User selects "Summarize" from the AI actions
   - System processes the transcript and generates a summary
   - Summary is displayed as a card in the UI

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The `processWithAI` function in `audio-recorder.tsx` handles the summarization process
   - Initially creates a placeholder card with `generating: true` status
   - Calls the `summarizeText` function which makes an API request to `/api/ai/summarize`
   - The API route uses OpenAI to generate a summary with a specific prompt
   - Updates the placeholder card with the generated content
   - For authenticated users, saves the summary to the database
   - Maintains a connection between the summary and its original transcript

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Summaries are stored in the `analyses` table with `analysis_type` set to "summary"
   - Each summary can be linked to a transcription via the `transcription_id` field
   - The `originalId` property in the UI maintains this connection
   - The `originalIdMap` state tracks these relationships for the current session

4. **Card Duplication Fix**:
   - Previous implementation created two cards for each summary:
     - One from updating the placeholder card
     - Another when saving to the database
   - Fixed by:
     - First saving to the database to get the analysis ID
     - Then updating the placeholder card with the content and originalId
     - Avoiding the creation of a second card entirely
   - This ensures only one card appears per summary while maintaining database integration

5. **Transcript Reference**:
   - Each summary card can expand to show its original transcript
   - The transcript is fetched on demand using the `fetchTranscriptionForAnalysis` function
   - This function uses the `originalId` to retrieve the associated transcript
   - Transcripts are cached in the `transcriptMap` to avoid repeated fetching
