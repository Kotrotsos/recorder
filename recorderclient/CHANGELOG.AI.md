3. Created a new API endpoint for translation at `src/app/api/ai/translate/route.ts`
4. Added a new `translateText` function to the API client in `src/lib/api-client.ts`
5. Enhanced the AudioRecorder component with translation functionality:
   - Added state for translated content, title, and language selection
   - Implemented a `handleTranslate` function to process translation requests
   - Updated the modal UI to display translated content when available
   - Connected the language dropdown and translate button to the translation functionality

### Files Changed:
- `src/lib/ai/prompts/translate.ts` (new file)
- `src/lib/ai/prompts/index.ts`
- `src/app/api/ai/translate/route.ts` (new file)
- `src/lib/api-client.ts`
- `src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx`

### Purpose:
This update adds the ability to translate transcript content and titles in the modal view. Users can select a target language from the dropdown and click the translate button to see the content translated into that language. The original content is preserved, and the translation is displayed in its place when available.

## March 14, 2025 - 17:06 CET - Fixed Modal UI and Restored Original Transcript Functionality

### Changes Made:
1. Restored the original UI styling for the modal dialog to match the rest of the site components
2. Fixed the "load original transcript" functionality that was broken in the previous update
3. Improved the modal layout with proper styling for headers, content, and footer
4. Restored the ability to view original transcripts for analyses and summaries
5. Fixed the logic for fetching and displaying transcripts in the modal view
6. Maintained the translation functionality while restoring the original UI design

### Files Changed:
- `src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx`

### Purpose:
This update restores the consistent UI styling across the application while maintaining the new translation functionality. The modal now matches the design language of the rest of the site with proper backdrop blur, border styling, and component layout. The "Original Transcript" functionality has been fixed to properly fetch and display transcripts when clicked.

## March 14, 2025 - 17:12 CET - Added Persistent Translation Storage

### Changes Made:
1. Created a new database migration to add a `translations` table for storing translated content
2. Updated database types to include the new translations table
3. Added database functions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting translations
4. Enhanced the AudioRecorder component to:
   - Store translations in the database when created
   - Check for existing translations before making new API calls
   - Load translations automatically when switching languages
   - Maintain translation state across page reloads
5. Implemented proper error handling for translation operations

### Files Changed:
- `supabase/migrations/20250314170800_add_translations_table.sql` (new file)
- `src/types/database.types.ts`
- `src/lib/db.ts`
- `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts`
- `src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx`

### Purpose:
This update adds persistence to the translation functionality. When a user translates content to a specific language, that translation is stored in the database and will be automatically retrieved when the user selects that language again, even after page reloads. This improves the user experience by eliminating the need to re-translate content and reduces API calls to the translation service.

## 2025-03-14 22:01:28 - Added Loading Indicator and Page Transition System

### Changes
- Added a new LoadingProvider context to manage loading states across the application
- Created a LoadingSpinner component for visual feedback during loading
- Created a LoadingOverlay component that wraps content and displays a loading indicator
- Updated the UISettingsProvider to better handle style application during page transitions
- Modified the root layout to incorporate the loading system into the application

### Files Changed
- Created `src/contexts/loading-context.tsx`
- Created `src/components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx`
- Created `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`
- Modified `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Modified `src/contexts/ui-settings-context.tsx`

### Reason for Changes
This change addresses an issue where styling wasn't being properly applied when navigating between pages. The new loading system ensures that components are only rendered after all styles have been properly loaded and applied. The loading indicator provides visual feedback to users during this process, improving the overall user experience.

The system works by creating a loading context that tracks the loading state, and a loading overlay component that only renders the page content once everything is ready. The UI settings context has been enhanced to better handle style application during page transitions.

## 2025-03-14 22:05:34 - Enhanced Loading System and User Experience

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where the loading spinner would sometimes keep spinning indefinitely
- Added a safety timeout (5 seconds) to prevent infinite loading states
- Improved error handling in the loading context to ensure loading always completes
- Enhanced route change detection to better handle navigation events

### Enhanced
- Updated the loading overlay with a beautiful dark neutral gradient background
- Changed background from plain color to gradient (dark blue to deep navy)
- Improved visibility of the loading spinner against the new background
- Added blur effect to the loading overlay for a more modern look
- Updated text color for better readability on the gradient background

### Files Changed
- Modified `src/contexts/loading-context.tsx`
- Modified `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`
- Modified `src/components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx`

### Reason for Changes
These changes address a usability issue where the loading spinner would sometimes get stuck in an infinite state, preventing users from accessing content. The safety timeout ensures users will always see content even if there's an issue with the loading process. Additionally, the visual enhancements to the loading overlay provide a more polished and professional appearance during loading states, improving the overall user experience.

## 2025-03-14 22:13:24 - Fixed Loading Overlay Hydration Error

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical React hydration error in the LoadingOverlay component
- Replaced mixed Tailwind classes and inline styles with consistent style objects
- Added client-side detection to conditionally apply backdrop blur effects
- Used React CSSProperties typing for proper TypeScript compliance
- Implemented a solution that ensures consistent rendering between server and client
- Removed all styling differences that were causing the hydration mismatch

### Files Changed
- Modified `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`

### Reason for Changes
This fix addresses a React hydration error that was occurring because the server and client were rendering different HTML for the loading overlay. The error appeared as:

```
Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client.
```

The issue was caused by mixing Tailwind classes and inline styles that were being processed differently between server and client rendering. By moving all styling to inline style objects with proper typing and adding client-side detection for browser-specific features like blur effects, we ensure that the HTML generated on both server and client is consistent, eliminating the hydration error.
