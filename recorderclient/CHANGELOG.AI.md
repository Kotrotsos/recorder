- **Increased** opacity and size of dropdown chevron icons for better visibility
- **Added** explicit white color to all dropdown icons for better contrast
- **Fixed** issue where dropdown indicators were difficult to see on the dark background
- **Files modified**: 
  - src/components/ui/select.tsx
  - src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx
  - src/components/auth/webhook-settings.tsx

This change significantly improves the visibility of dropdown indicators across the application by making the chevron icons larger, increasing their opacity to 100%, and ensuring they have a white color that stands out against the dark backgrounds. The change affects all dropdown selectors in both the audio recorder component and webhook settings.

## March 21, 2025 - 09:30 CET

### Fixed
- **Fixed** edit functionality to ensure recorder component expands when clicking edit
- **Resolved** issue where editing was impossible because recorder remained minimized
- **Enhanced** user experience when using the edit feature in expanded cards
- **Files modified**: src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx

This change fixes an issue where clicking the edit button in an expanded card would load the transcript into the editor but the recorder component would remain minimized, making it impossible for users to see or interact with the editor. The fix ensures the recorder component automatically expands when the edit feature is used.

## March 21, 2025 - 09:00 CET

### Added
- **Added** edit functionality to expanded card view with pencil icon
- **Implemented** feature to bring original transcript back to recording component for new transformations
- **Enhanced** workflow by allowing users to quickly edit or reuse transcripts for different processing
- **Improved** UI with clear visual indicators for edit functionality
- **Files modified**: src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx

This change adds a new edit button (pencil icon) in the bottom right of expanded cards. When clicked, it allows users to bring the original transcript back to the recording component's Write tab so they can use it to generate a new transformation or edit it further.

## March 20, 2025 - 21:36 CET

### Fixed
- **Fixed** dropdown options in the Write tab to match the Record tab
- **Removed** "Summarize" and "Analyze" options from the Write tab
- **Added** custom prompt support to the Write tab
- **Improved** consistency between tabs for a better user experience
- **Enhanced** button disabling logic for custom prompts in the Write tab
- **Files modified**: src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx

This change ensures consistency across all tabs (Record, Upload, and Write) by standardizing the available AI processing options. The Write tab now offers the same functionality as the Record tab, including support for custom prompts when the user is authenticated.

## March 20, 2025 - 20:22 CET

### Added
- **Added** new "Write" tab to the audio recorder interface
- **Implemented** text input area where users can write or paste text
- **Modified** the tab grid to have three columns (Record, Upload, Write)
- **Adjusted** the process button to reflect text processing instead of audio when using the Write tab
- **Enhanced** processing logic to use typed/pasted text content when available
- **Files modified**: src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx

This change allows users to directly input text in addition to recording or uploading audio, providing a more flexible interface for content creation and AI processing. The Write tab offers the same AI processing options as the other tabs but bypasses audio recording/uploading when the user just wants to work with text.

## March 20, 2025 - 19:04 CET

- Created a LoadingSpinner component for visual feedback during loading
- Created a LoadingOverlay component that wraps content and displays a loading indicator
- Updated the UISettingsProvider to better handle style application during page transitions
- Modified the root layout to incorporate the loading system into the application

### Files Changed
- Created `src/contexts/loading-context.tsx`
- Created `src/components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx`
- Created `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`
- Modified `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Modified `src/contexts/ui-settings-context.tsx`

### Reason for Changes
This change addresses an issue where styling wasn't being properly applied when navigating between pages. The new loading system ensures that components are only rendered after all styles have been properly loaded and applied. The loading indicator provides visual feedback to users during this process, improving the overall user experience.

The system works by creating a loading context that tracks the loading state, and a loading overlay component that only renders the page content once everything is ready. The UI settings context has been enhanced to better handle style application during page transitions.

## 2025-03-14 22:05:34 - Enhanced Loading System and User Experience

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where the loading spinner would sometimes keep spinning indefinitely
- Added a safety timeout (5 seconds) to prevent infinite loading states
- Improved error handling in the loading context to ensure loading always completes
- Enhanced route change detection to better handle navigation events

### Enhanced
- Updated the loading overlay with a beautiful dark neutral gradient background
- Changed background from plain color to gradient (dark blue to deep navy)
- Improved visibility of the loading spinner against the new background
- Added blur effect to the loading overlay for a more modern look
- Updated text color for better readability on the gradient background

### Files Changed
- Modified `src/contexts/loading-context.tsx`
- Modified `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`
- Modified `src/components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx`

### Reason for Changes
These changes address a usability issue where the loading spinner would sometimes get stuck in an infinite state, preventing users from accessing content. The safety timeout ensures users will always see content even if there's an issue with the loading process. Additionally, the visual enhancements to the loading overlay provide a more polished and professional appearance during loading states, improving the overall user experience.

## 2025-03-14 22:13:24 - Fixed Loading Overlay Hydration Error

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical React hydration error in the LoadingOverlay component
- Replaced mixed Tailwind classes and inline styles with consistent style objects
- Added client-side detection to conditionally apply backdrop blur effects
- Used React CSSProperties typing for proper TypeScript compliance
- Implemented a solution that ensures consistent rendering between server and client
- Removed all styling differences that were causing the hydration mismatch

### Files Changed
- Modified `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`

### Reason for Changes
This fix addresses a React hydration error that was occurring because the server and client were rendering different HTML for the loading overlay. The error appeared as:

```
Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client.
```

The issue was caused by mixing Tailwind classes and inline styles that were being processed differently between server and client rendering. By moving all styling to inline style objects with proper typing and adding client-side detection for browser-specific features like blur effects, we ensure that the HTML generated on both server and client is consistent, eliminating the hydration error.

## March 14, 2025 - 22:39 CET

### Added
- Created LoadingProvider context to manage application loading states
- Implemented LoadingOverlay component for displaying loading indicators

- Fixed inconsistencies in the card header display for transcribe type results
- Ensured that processed transcripts appear as cards in the UI, similar to summary and analysis cards
- Updated the expanded card dialog to properly handle transcribe type results

The issue was that the UI components weren't properly handling the "transcribe" result type, causing processed transcripts not to appear properly in the card display. This has been fixed by updating all relevant display components to recognize and handle the "transcribe" type alongside the existing "summarize" and "analyze" types.

## 2023-05-14 - Custom Prompt Feature Implementation

Results are saved to the database and displayed as result cards, consistent with other AI processing options.

### Files Modified
- `src/components/audio/audio-recorder.tsx`
- `src/lib/api-client.ts`
- `src/lib/db.ts`
- `pages/api/prompts/process.ts` (new file)

## 2023-05-15 - Fixed Custom Prompt Processing Error

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed Custom Prompt API Client**
   - Updated the `processWithCustomPrompt` function in the API client to use the correct App Router API endpoint
   - Changed the API endpoint from `/api/prompts/process` (Pages Router) to `/api/ai/process-custom-prompt` (App Router)
   - Added proper error handling for HTTP status codes and parsing failures
   - Implemented timeout handling with AbortController for better reliability

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
