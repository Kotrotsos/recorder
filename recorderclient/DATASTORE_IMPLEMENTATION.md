# Datastore Implementation Post-Mortem

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the datastore for the Recorder application using Supabase. The datastore is responsible for storing and managing user data, including audio files, transcriptions, analyses, and user profiles.

## What We Did

1. **Created Database Schema**: We defined a comprehensive database schema with tables for profiles, files, transcriptions, analyses, and subscriptions. Each table has appropriate relationships and constraints to ensure data integrity.

2. **Set Up Storage**: We configured a storage bucket for audio files, with security policies to ensure that users can only access their own files.

3. **Implemented Row Level Security (RLS)**: We added RLS policies to all tables to ensure that users can only access their own data. This is a critical security feature that prevents unauthorized access to data.

4. **Created Database Utility Functions**: We implemented a set of utility functions in `src/lib/db.ts` to interact with the database. These functions handle CRUD operations for all the tables.

5. **Created a React Hook**: We created a custom React hook in `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts` to make it easy to use the database functions in the frontend. This hook provides a clean API for components to interact with the database.

6. **Fixed Authentication**: We updated the Supabase client and middleware to use the correct cookie handling pattern, which is essential for authentication to work properly.

7. **Added Documentation**: We created comprehensive documentation in `supabase/README.md` and `DATABASE_SETUP.md` to explain how to set up and use the database.

## Why We Did It

1. **Structured Data Storage**: By creating a well-defined database schema, we ensure that data is stored in a structured and organized way, making it easier to query and manipulate.

2. **Security**: By implementing RLS policies, we ensure that users can only access their own data, which is essential for a multi-user application.

3. **Scalability**: The database schema is designed to be scalable, with separate tables for different types of data. This makes it easier to add new features in the future.

4. **User Experience**: By storing user data in a database, we can provide a seamless experience where users can access their data from any device.

5. **Future Payment System**: We included a subscriptions table to support a future payment system, making it easier to implement this feature later.

## How We Did It

1. **Database Schema**: We used SQL migrations to define the database schema. These migrations are stored in the `supabase/migrations` directory and can be run using the Supabase CLI.

2. **Storage**: We configured a storage bucket for audio files using the Supabase Storage API. Files are stored in a folder structure based on the user ID.

3. **Row Level Security**: We added RLS policies to all tables using SQL. These policies use the `auth.uid()` function to check if the user is authorized to access the data.

4. **Database Utility Functions**: We implemented utility functions using the Supabase JavaScript client. These functions handle CRUD operations for all the tables.

5. **React Hook**: We created a custom React hook that uses the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the database. This hook provides a clean API for components to use.

6. **Authentication**: We updated the Supabase client and middleware to use the correct cookie handling pattern, which is essential for authentication to work properly.

7. **Documentation**: We created comprehensive documentation to explain how to set up and use the database.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Cookie Handling**: The Supabase client and middleware were using a deprecated cookie handling pattern. We updated them to use the correct pattern, which is essential for authentication to work properly.

2. **Type Safety**: We created a `database.types.ts` file to define the types for the database schema. This ensures type safety when interacting with the database.

3. **Error Handling**: We added comprehensive error handling to all database functions to ensure that errors are properly caught and reported.

4. **Security**: We implemented RLS policies to ensure that users can only access their own data. This is a critical security feature that prevents unauthorized access to data.

## Future Improvements

1. **Pagination**: Add pagination to the database queries to handle large datasets more efficiently.

2. **Search**: Implement full-text search for transcriptions and analyses to make it easier for users to find specific content.

3. **Caching**: Add caching to improve performance and reduce database load.

4. **Offline Support**: Implement offline support to allow users to work with their data even when they are not connected to the internet.

5. **Analytics**: Add analytics to track how users are using the application and identify areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

The datastore implementation provides a solid foundation for the Recorder application. It ensures that user data is stored securely and can be accessed efficiently. The implementation is also designed to be scalable, making it easier to add new features in the future.
